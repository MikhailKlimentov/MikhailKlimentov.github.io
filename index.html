Hi!
<br/>
I'm Mikhail Klimentov (you might also know me as LeaderGrev). I currently work at Atlantic 57, <i>The Atlantic's</i> digital consultancy, as an associate on the editorial team.

I love comedy, the oxford comma, and parenthetical asides (among other things). This site is super under construction, but I just love to brag about this sweet, sweet, url.
