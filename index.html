Hi!
<br/><br/>
My name is Mikhail Klimentov (or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/LeaderGrev">@LeaderGrev</a> on Twitter). I currently work at Atlantic 57, <i>The Atlantic's</i> digital consultancy, as an associate editor. I'm also the deputy editor of <a href="http://www.brinknews.com">BRINK News</a>, a daily publication which covers new thinking on corporate risk and resilience in the global economy. I have written and recruited pieces on a diverse range of topics for the site, including interviews with <a href="https://www.brinknews.com/is-antitrust-enforcement-the-wests-best-weapon-against-chinese-tech/">Tim Wu about antitrust enforcement</a> and with <a href="http://www.brinknews.com/how-do-we-think-about-the-winners-and-losers-from-globalization/"> a former WTO lawyer</a> about the language around trade and globalization, and pieces about <a href="http://www.brinknews.com/if-you-want-more-men-in-caregiving-dont-call-it-a-pink-collar-job/">gender divisions and labor</a> as well as <a href="http://www.brinknews.com/when-we-talk-about-human-trafficking-we-also-need-to-talk-about-tech-heres-why/">tech and human trafficking</a>.
<br/><br/> 
I'm also an editor and contributor to Atlantic 57's flagship weekly newsletter, the Five/Seven, which covers trends, best practices, and (sometimes!) worst practices in digital media.

I love comedy, the oxford comma, and parenthetical asides (among other things). This site is super under construction, but I just love to brag about this sweet, sweet, url.
