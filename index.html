Hi!
<br/>
I'm Mikhail Klimentov (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/LeaderGrev">@LeaderGrev</a> on Twitter). I currently work at Atlantic 57, <i>The Atlantic's</i> digital consultancy, as an associate on the editorial team. 
<br/><br/>
I love comedy, the oxford comma, and parenthetical asides (among other things). This site is super under construction, but I just love to brag about this sweet, sweet, url. test.
