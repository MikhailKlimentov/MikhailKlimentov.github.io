Hi!
<br/>
I'm Mikhail Klimentov (you might also know me as LeaderGrev). I currently work at <i>The Atlantic</i> as an editorial fellow. I love comedy, the oxford comma, and parenthetical asides (among other things). This site is super under construction (but I just love to brag about this sweet, sweet, url).
